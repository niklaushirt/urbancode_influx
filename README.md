Note: This is not the plugin distributable! This is the source code. To find the installable plugin, go into the 'Releases' tab, and download a stable version.

### License
This plugin is protected under the [Eclipse Public 1.0 License](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html)

### Compatibility
	The IBM UrbanCode Deploy automation plugin uses InfluxDB's Web API.
	This plug-in requires version 6.1.1 or later of IBM UrbanCode Deploy.
    
### Installation
	The packaged zip is located in the releases folder. No special steps are required for installation.
	See Installing plug-ins in UrbanCode Deploy. Download this zip file if you wish to skip the 
	manual build step. Otherwise, download the entire InfluxDB-UCD and 
	run the "ant" command in the top level folder. This should compile the code and create
	a new distributable zip within the releases folder. Use this command if you wish to make
	your own changes to the plugin.
